            <p>
                I was born and raised in the city of Lagos, Nigeria. My educational journey began at Honeyland Montessori School in Lagos, where I completed my primary education from 2004 to 2010. Following this, I attended Airforce Comprehensive School in Ibadan for my secondary education, graduating in 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                For higher education, I enrolled at the University of Lagos, where I studied marine science from 2016 until my graduation in 2024. Despite completing my university education, I am currently seeking employment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my personal life, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged and continuously learning. I have a passion for coding, which allows me to explore the world of technology and innovation. I am also an avid reader, finding joy and knowledge in the pages of books. Additionally, I enjoy gaming, a pastime that provides both entertainment and a sense of community. Cooking is another one of my interests, and I love experimenting with different recipes and flavors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am single and have no children. While I have not yet achieved major career milestones or received notable awards, I remain optimistic about the future and am committed to personal growth and professional development.

            <h1>Why I Joined Alt School</h1>
            <p>I have always had a deep interest in technology from a young age, but I wasn't able to pursue that passion during my university studies. Instead, I spent six years studying Marine Science at the University of Lagos. After graduation, I decided to follow my true passion and pursue my dreams in tech.</p>
            <p>AltSchool of Engineering provided the perfect opportunity to make this transition. Its practical, hands-on approach to learning, combined with the chance to work on projects, was exactly what I needed to develop my coding skills. Additionally, as an online school, AltSchool offers the flexibility to balance my studies with other pursuits. Joining AltSchool is the best step towards turning my lifelong interest in technology into a fulfilling career while allowing me to explore entrepreneurial ventures simultaneously.</p>

            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <p>My ultimate goal at AltSchool of Engineering is to become a full-stack developer. To achieve this, I am currently enrolled in the backend engineering course. My focus is on gaining a solid understanding of backend development while also building a foundation for future full-stack expertise.</p>
            <p>I aim to develop practical coding skills and apply them to real-world projects, creating a robust portfolio that demonstrates my abilities. Networking with industry experts and peers is also a priority, as it will provide valuable insights and opportunities for collaboration.</p>
            <p>The flexibility of AltSchool's online format allows me to balance my studies with other pursuits, such as starting a business. By integrating tech knowledge into my entrepreneurial ventures, I hope to create innovative solutions and drive success in both areas.</p>
